# NoteCardContainer Component Documentation

[TOC]

## 1. Overview

The `NoteCardContainer` component is a React component responsible for rendering a collection of notes. It utilizes the `NoteCard` and `Loader` components.  This component efficiently handles loading states and displays notes in a grid-like structure.

## 2. Component Structure

The `NoteCardContainer` component receives two props:

| Prop Name | Data Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `notes` | Array | An array of note objects. Each note object is expected to have at least an `id` property. |
| `loading` | Boolean | A boolean value indicating whether the notes are currently loading.  `true` indicates loading, `false` indicates loading is complete. |


The component's structure is as follows:

1. **Outer Container:** A `div` with the class `container` acts as the main wrapper.
2. **Grid Container:** A nested `div` with the class `note-has-grid row` provides a grid layout for the notes (presumably using CSS grid or flexbox).
3. **Loading Indicator:** A conditional rendering of the `Loader` component displays a loading indicator while `loading` prop is `true`.
4. **Note Cards:** The `notes` array is mapped using `.map()` to render a `NoteCard` component for each note. The `key` prop is set to `note.id` to ensure efficient updates by React's reconciliation algorithm.

## 3. Code Breakdown

```javascript
import React from 'react'
import NoteCard from './NoteCard'
import Loader from './Loader'

const NoteCardContainer = ({notes, loading}) => {
  return (
    <div className="container">
      <div className="note-has-grid row">

        { loading && <Loader loading={loading} /> }

        { notes.map(note => <NoteCard key={note.id} note={note} />)}

      </div>
    </div>
  )
}

export default NoteCardContainer
```

The core logic lies in the conditional rendering of the `Loader` and the mapping of the `notes` array.  The `&&` operator ensures that the `Loader` is only rendered when the `loading` prop is `true`. The `.map()` method iterates through the `notes` array, creating a `NoteCard` component for each note.  The `key` prop is crucial for React's efficient rendering and update mechanism; it uniquely identifies each `NoteCard` instance.  The use of a functional component ensures efficient rendering and reduces boilerplate.


## 4. Dependencies

The `NoteCardContainer` component depends on the following components:

*   `NoteCard`:  A component responsible for rendering a single note.  (Assumed to be defined elsewhere and handles the presentation of individual note data).
*   `Loader`: A component that displays a loading indicator. (Assumed to be defined elsewhere and handles the visual representation of loading state).


## 5.  Assumptions

* The `NoteCard` component correctly handles rendering individual notes based on the data provided in the `note` prop.
* The `Loader` component displays an appropriate visual loading indicator while data is fetched.
* The CSS classes (`container`, `note-has-grid`, `row`) are defined and style the component appropriately.  (Presumably using a CSS framework or custom stylesheet).
