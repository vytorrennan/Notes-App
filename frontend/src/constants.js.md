# Internal Documentation: Authentication Tokens

[TOC]

## 1. Introduction

This document details the implementation of the authentication tokens used within the application.  Currently, only two tokens are defined: `ACCESS_TOKEN` and `REFRESH_TOKEN`.

## 2. Token Constants

The application uses constants to store the names of the access and refresh tokens.  This approach enhances code readability and maintainability, and reduces the risk of typos.

| Constant Name      | Value       | Description                                      |
|----------------------|--------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `ACCESS_TOKEN`      | `"access"`   | Identifier for the access token.                 |
| `REFRESH_TOKEN`     | `"refresh"`  | Identifier for the refresh token.                |


## 3.  Detailed Explanation of Functions (None)

This module only defines constants; no functions are present. Therefore, no detailed function explanations are needed.  The simplicity of the module allows for easy understanding and maintenance.


## 4. Future Considerations

Future development may involve:

*   Adding more token types (e.g., `RESET_PASSWORD_TOKEN`).
*   Implementing a more robust token management system (e.g., using a dedicated token store).
*   Integrating with external authentication providers.
